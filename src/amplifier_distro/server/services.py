The server creates ONE set of services at startup and shares them

its own backend independently.

    # At server startup (in cli.py):

    services = init_services(dev_mode=True)

    # In app route handlers:
    from amplifier_distro.server.services import get_services

    # In tests:
    from amplifier_distro.server.services import init_services, reset_services
