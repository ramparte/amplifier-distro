# Contents of the distro

## TBD Now

- web chat interface
  - first-run/setup
  - simple chat
  - configuration of the distro
      - providers
      - bundle configuration (maybe the thing we don't need first but why not - again, easily be able to add/remove things. My bundle is fucked up all the time, and I hate having to fix it. I want to be able to say "grab this new functionality into my environment" and have it just work.
  - feature toggles during setup/config
- tui interface
- cli

- distro features
  - local memory, everything can access, (user memory)
  - slack bridge
  - voice bridge

## Future

- Also I am working on "amplifier routines" which will get added in when ready, etc.

## Notes

- For now that plus the full list of surfaces (CLI, GUI/Kepler, TUI and Web (whichever one we settled on)). Each of those ought to come up cleanly, be able to use the same memory/bundle/list of sessions system. As should slack and voice (for example, I can ask slack "what's the list of things").
- So all of this is just a starting point, we will add to it as we add new coolness. Slack swarm is on my list, maybe some version stories if we feel like it's valuable, the m365 vibe coding thing, installing into different cloud environments etc
